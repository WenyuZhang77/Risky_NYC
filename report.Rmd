## Introduction and Motivation

This project is motivated by recent crime news in New York City we’ve read. In the 1980s, New York was one of the most crime-ridden cities in the United States. From the 1990s to the 2010s, the crime rate of NYC dropped sharply, which gave NYC one of the lowest crime rates of major cities in the Unites States. However, robberies, harassments, dangerous weapons… crimes are still happening around us all the time. As brand-new residents of NYC, the main purpose of this project is to explore the security situation and stability of this city. In addition, analyzing crime data from NYPD might raise the safety awareness of the victim population as well as other citizens and visitors, thus they can avoid high-crime areas. More importantly, our project could also provide housing and daily travel advice to freshmen and tourists.

## Questions


## Data

### Data source

The data was collected from [NYC open data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i), which is about NYPD Complaint Data Historic. This dataset includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to the end of last year (2020). The data was collected annually. The dataset has 7.38M rows and 35 variables; each row is a complaint.

### Data Cleaning

The data was first imported into R. This is a huge dataset which contains about 7.5 million rows, so we have to do some data cleaning before doing data analysis. After reading the data, we deleted some columns (variables) which include too many blank spaces, since we thought they were not helpful for our data analysis. Then, for the convenience of further data analysis, we divided the variable `cmplnt_fr_dt` (the exact date of occurrence for the reported case) into three variables: `year`, `month`, and `day`. Since this dataset is too large for a normal personal computer to run, we divided it into more than a dozen small datasets by year to speed up data processing. Our current data analysis is mostly based on 2020’s dataset, because it’s the latest year's data.
